## Description

This package provides libraries for capturing analytics events from [@adobe/create-ccweb-add-on](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/create-ccweb-add-on) runs and sending those to Adobe, therefore providing invaluable insights on usage of the application. With this, Adobe can further improve the experience it provides to its developers.

Please be assured that no confidential information is captured or shared. Besides, analytics events are captured only when you provide consent. If at any point of time, you decide to revoke your consent, you may do so by running any of the `ccweb-add-on` commands with the flag `--analytics off`. Similarly, if you wish to turn it back on, you may use the flag `--analytics on`.
